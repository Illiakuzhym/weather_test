## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on API design

This project fully follows the provided Swagger (OpenAPI) specification without changes to endpoints, request formats, or response contracts, as required by the task.

However, I would like to point out that certain aspects of the specification could be improved from a design perspective. For example:

- `POST /subscribe` uses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead of `application/json`, which is less typical for modern APIs.
- `/confirm/{token}` and `/unsubscribe/{token}` rely on exposing raw tokens in GET URLs ‚Äî this may not be ideal for long-term security and RESTfulness.
- There is no route for listing subscriptions or checking status (useful for development or admin tools).

These points were not changed in the implementation, in full respect of the given task constraints.
